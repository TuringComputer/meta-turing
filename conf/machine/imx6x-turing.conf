#@MAINTAINER: Mauricio Cirelli <mauricio@turingcomputer.com.br>

# Machine config for the Turing Computer i.MX6 Evaluation Board machines.
# They all use the same machine config, since the u-boot SPL autodetects the
# machine type upon booting. SOC_FAMILY includes all SoCs from all of these machines
# to let recipes include firmware etc. for all of these SoCs.
